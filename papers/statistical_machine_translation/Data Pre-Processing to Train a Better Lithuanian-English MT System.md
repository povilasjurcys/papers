### Problem
Is it possible to improve translation quality by preprocessing text of LT (or other inflected) language


### Takeaway

It looks like author tries totaly random guesses how to improve translation and it gets not signifficant result (but it claims, that results are signifficant..). I like the idea, that even simple preprocessing might improve translation quality and thus leaves us with a hope that translation can be improved with super-smart preprocessing. On the other hand I think author should also compare results with factored SMT, because preprocessing is almost the same as using factored corpora for training SMT.
